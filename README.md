# Description
A minigame where mobs try to break your factory and it's defenses as you try to earn money.
The mobs get stronger as time goes on until the "core" of your factory is destroyed,
but you are able to afford stronger and stronger defenses, and better ways of earning money
until you die and have to restart.

## Working on:
- Simple placement mechanics and UI

### UI idea:
Basic catagories in hotbar and you can offhand a catagory to open it
and hotbar gets replaced with members of that catagory.
Drop item to go back

### Current plan:
- ~detect right clicks~
- ~raycast position~
- ~place a structure~
- ~place more stuctures~
- rotate and flip structures
- deleate structurs
- full ui

## Finished:
- basic conveyor designs

## Still need:
- core of the factory
- conveyors
- mobs that can break defenses/the factory itself
- grace period
- walls, traps, etc.

## Possible changes?
- make it into a strategy game where you can send mobs to another factory (too complex even for this?)
